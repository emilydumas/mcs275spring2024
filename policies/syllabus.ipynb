    "This course is a second semester of study in introductory computer science, designed for students who have completed CS 107, CS 109, CS 111, or MCS 260.  Students will gain experience designing, writing, and debugging more complex programs than are seen in the prerequisite courses.  Some important examples of data structures and algorithms will also be presented, both in theoretical terms and by implementing them in Python.  Students will also learn to manage files in the terminal and to use some terminal-based software development tools."

    "\n",
    "Lectures and labs are held in person in the rooms listed [above](#Basics), and under normal circumstances, attending each course meeting in person is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students should not come to class while sick or while experiencing symptoms of illness.  We understand that occasional absences happen for various other reasons as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For lectures, we provide two alternative means to view the lecture if you cannot attend in person:\n",
    "* Lectures can be live streamed from the Blackboard site using *Echo 360*, a lecture capture tool that uses cameras built in to our lecture rooms, and\n",
    "* Recordings of the lectures will be posted to the Blacboard site (usually later in the same day the lecture occurs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that streaming and recording is handled automatically by a system managed by UIC IT.  If you encounter any issues accessing streams or recordings, contact [ITHelp@uic.edu](mailto:ITHelp@uic.edu).\n",
    "\n",
    "No permission is needed to attend lecture remotely using the live stream or to view a recording in place of coming to lecture.  However, students should not use these alternative means on a regular basis.  Delivery of the lectures is optimized for the in-person experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weekly labs are longer meetings focused on students working individually or in small groups on activities that reinforce and expand on the lecture material with the guidance and assistance of one of the course TAs.  This important practice is an essential part of the course, and is more difficult to replicate remotely.  Labs will not be live streamed or recorded, and students who will miss a lab for any reason should email their TA as soon as possible (ideally in advance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recording and grading lab attendance\n",
    "Attendance will be recorded in each weekly lab meeting, and lab attendance will account for 10% of the final grade.  The way this will be done is by assigning a score of 0 (absent) or 1 (present) to you for each lab.  At the end of the semester **your two lowest lab attendance scores will be dropped**, and the remaining scores averaged.  Since there are 15 labs in total, this means that as long as you attend at least 13 of them, your lab attendance score will be 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plans in case of instructor absence\n",
    "\n",
    "Except in cases of a last-minute emergency that prevents alternate plans from being made, if the instructor cannot give a lecture on campus at the regular time (e.g. due to illness, required quarantine, or other unexpected event), one of these things will happen:\n",
    "* The lecture will be run remotely on zoom, using a zoom meeting link posted on the course blackboard site\n",
    "* A substitute instructor will give the lecture\n",
    "* An asynchronous lecture video will be recorded and posted to the course site\n",
    "\n",

Such AI tools are evolving rapidly, and some of them can generate simple program code or documentation text in response to requests or prompts.  However, the code generated by such tools is sometimes subtly wrong.  In this course you will work toward the proficiency in reading and writing computer programs that would be necessary to responsibly use AI coding tools, and completing the course assignments without such assistance is an essential part of that.  Therefore, students who use such tools for class assignments undermine the learning objectives of this course, reducing the effectiveness of the instruction and feedback we provide.

Students who face or anticipate disability-related barriers while at UIC should connect with the [Disability Resource Center (DRC)](https://drc.uic.edu/) to create a plan for reasonable accommodations. In order to receive accommodations, students must disclose disability to the DRC, complete an interactive registration process with the DRC, and provide their course instructor with a Letter of Accommodation (LOA). Course instructors in receipt of an LOA will work with the student and the DRC to implement approved accommodations.\n",

    "> The faculty of the University of Illinois Chicago shall make every effort to avoid scheduling examinations or requiring that student projects be turned in or completed on religious holidays.  Students who wish to observe their religious holidays shall notify the faculty member by the tenth day of the semester of the date when they will be absent unless the religious holiday is observed on or before the tenth day of the semester. In such cases, the students shall notify the faculty member at least five days in advance of the date when they will be absent. In cases when the exact date(s) of the religious holiday is/are not known at the start of the semester, the student should notify the faculty member as soon as the exact date is known. Students should be asked to report if such situations might occur within the first four weeks of the semester. The faculty member shall make every reasonable effort to honor the request, not penalize the student for missing the class, and if an examination or project is due during the absence, give the student an exam or assignment equivalent to the one completed by those students in attendance. If the student feels aggrieved, they may request remedy through the campus grievance procedure.\n",
