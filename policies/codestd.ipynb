    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the only section of the document you absolutely need to read.  The rest of the document might help you understand these rules better, but the rules themselves are just:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CS1 - Header:** The first three lines of the main Python file of any assignment must be comment lines (i.e. must start with `#`), and these lines must contain this information:\n",
    "    * Line 1: The course and assignment (e.g. MCS 275 Spring 2024 Homework 5)\n",
    "    * Line 2: Your full name\n",
    "    * Line 3: A statement accurately describing the authorship and/or sources of the work (which under the course rules should either be that you wrote it from scratch, or that we provided some template and that you are the sole author of the changes made to that template).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CS2 - Comments and docstrings:** Explanatory text is included, when appropriate, in the form of comment lines (starting with `#`) and not in any other way.  For example, including string literals with explanatory text is not acceptable unless the string literal is a docstring.  Comments are appropriate to clarify *why* and *how* things are done.  Docstrings (meaning a string literal that appears as the first statement inside a function, module, method, or class definition, and which describes the purpose of that object) should be included for all classes, for any function of significant complexity, and for any method other than special methods (whose names begin and end with `__`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CS3 - Informative names:** Names of functions, variables, and classes should be descriptive and not abbreviated to the point of incomprehensibility.  For example, single-letter names should be avoided except for variables that have a very short scope and obvious purpose (e.g. an iterator in a short loop or a comprehension expression)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CS4 - Indenting:** Use at least two spaces to indent a block of code relative to its parent.  Use that same number of spaces for all indented blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CS5 - Avoid pointless conversions:** Don’t use `str()` on something that is already a string, don't use `int()` on something that is already an integer, don’t convert a string to a list just to index it (strings already support indexing!), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CS6 - Avoid manual indexing:** Any time you need perform some operation for every element of a list or other data structure, use Python's iterator protocol (e.g. `for x in L:`, followed by use of `x`) rather than manual indexing (e.g. `for i in range(len(L)):`, followed by use of `L[i]`).  If you believe `range(len(...)))` and manual indexing is the natural way to approach a task you are given in this course, ask the instructor or TA for confirmation."
