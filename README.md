# MCS 275 Spring 2024

Code and related materials shared with students in MCS 275 in Spring 2024 at UIC.

Students in the course are directed to this repository to view or download Python source files (.py) containing sample code, including code written during lectures.

Some course documents (e.g. syllabus, worksheets, homework) are also stored here as Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files. These are rendered to HTML documents that are shared with students.
