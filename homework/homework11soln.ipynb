    "## 2.  More powerplants queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helpful tip**: \n",
    "First, here's an SQL feature that you should know about.  If you have a query that selects a bunch of rows, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT * FROM available_beverages WHERE caffeine_mg_per_liter > 400;\n",
    "```\n",
    "then you might want to know how many rows it returns.  Instead of fetching them all and counting them, it is better to have SQLite do the counting.  You can do that by replacing the `*` or the list of requested columns with `COUNT(*)`.  For example\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM available_beverages WHERE caffeine_mg_per_liter > 400;\n",
    "```\n",
    "is a query that returns a single row, which has a single column, which contains an integer.  That integer is the number of rows matching the SELECT statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task:** Write a python script `hwk11prob2.py` that connects to the power plants sqlite database (`powerplants.sqlite`) and performs appropriate SQL queries in order to print answers to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A. What are the five oldest power plants in the database, in terms of the year they were commissioned?  For each, list the name, the country, and the year it was commisioned (oldest first).  Power plants for which no commissioning date is included should be excluded from consideration.\n",
    "* B. How many nuclear power plants in the database are located in the southern hemisphere?\n",
    "* C. What percentage of the power plants in the United Kingdom are wind power plants?\n",
    "* D. What percentage of the total power generation capacity in the United Kingdom comes from wind power plants?\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, please paste the output of your program at the bottom of the code as a sequence of comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In this problem terms \"nuclear power plant\" and \"wind power plant\" always refer to the primary fuel used by a facility."
