    "\n",
    "In the task tracking application, let's define two types of \"troubled\" tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **stale task** is one that is in the \"waiting\" state and where the creation time is at least one week ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **long-running task** is one that is the \"in progress\" state and where the last update time is at least one week ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind these definitions is that both types of tasks might require additional attention or action---stale tasks have been waiting for a long time and may have been forgotten, while long-running tasks may have hit some kind of obstacle preventing progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a feature to the task tracking web app so that accessing the URL `localhost:5000/audit/troubled/` will show a page with the application logo/header, followed by a list of stale tasks, followed by a list of long-running tasks.  Each list should have a header (h2) above it indicating what it shows.  For each task in either list, the description, task id, state, and owner should be shown.  The new page should use the same CSS stylesheet as the rest of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modifications should consist of\n",
    "* One function added to `taskgain.py` or `activetask.py`\n",
    "* One HTML template added to the `templates/` subdirectory, which I recommend calling `troubled_task_audit.html`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test your work** but once it is working, do not submit the entire application.  Instead, copy and paste just the function you added to the python script into a new file called `hwk13.py`, and put the required header at the top of that file.  Then submit two files:`hwk13.py` and your new HTML template `troubled_task_audit.html`."
