    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a maze that is like the random mazes generated by `PrimRandomMaze` in the sense that there is exactly one path between any two points $p$ and $q$ that are not walls.  If you subtract one from the length of that path, the result is called the *path distance* between $p$ and $q$ which is denoted by $dist(p,q)$.  Subtracting one ensures that $dist(p,p)=0$ and that $dist(p,q)=1$ if $p$ and $q$ are neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $x$ is one of the points on the path from $p$ to $q$, then $dist(p,x) + dist(x,q) = dist(p,q)$.  This reflects the fact that you can stop at $x$ on your way from $p$ to $q$ without making any detour.  For a general point $x$, the quantity\n",
    "$$ dist(p,x) + dist(x,q) - dist(p,q) $$\n",
    "tells you the *detour distance* of $x$ during a trip from $p$ to $q$, meaning the minimum additional distance you would need to add to your trip from $p$ to $q$ in order to stop at $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function\n",

    "def maze_detour_dist(M,p,q,x):\n",

    "that takes a maze `M` and `Point2` objects `p`,`q`,`x` that are free locations (not walls) of `M`, and which computes and returns the detour distance of `x` during a trip from `p` to `q`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can (and should) use the function `maze_path` from problem 2 to do this.  Even if you don't get the function to work in problem 2, we'll evaluate your answer to this problem on the basis of whether it works when a correct `maze_path` function is provided."
