    "## 3. HTML to image\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a quick note about HTML:  In an HTML document, you can make a section of text (or even a single character) appear in a specific color as follows:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #8800aa;\">Deep purple</span>\n",
    "```\n",
    "which gives a result that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #8800aa;\">Deep purple</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "When this technique is used, it means the color of the text is found somewhere in the value of the `style` attribute of a `span` tag that contains the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, here's a web page that contains a picture of a cow:\n",

    "* [https://www.dumas.io/teaching/2024/spring/mcs275/data/moo.html](https://www.dumas.io/teaching/2024/spring/mcs275/data/moo.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you look at the source of the page, you'll see the page doesn't really contain an image at all.  Instead, it has many paragraphs full of unicode block characters (which look like &block; and are created with `&block;`).  Each block character is given a different color, so the resulting grid of blocks looks a bit like an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python script that downloads this HTML document linked above (the one the cow \"image\") and then uses `bs4` (beautiful soup) to parse the HTML and traverses the DOM to extract the color data.  It should then write a PNG image called `moo.png` in which each pixel corresponds to one of the block characters in the web page (and has the same color).  Use pillow (`PIL.Image`) to create the image file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're done, `moo.png` should look like a very small image of a cow.  Also, it will be a bit vertically squashed, because pixels are usually square while unicode characters are usually about twice as tall as they are wide.  If you've done everything correctly, the final image should have a width of 130 pixels and a height of 43 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, here is a function that takes a string like `#8800aa` and returns a tuple of integers like `(136, 0, 170)`."
