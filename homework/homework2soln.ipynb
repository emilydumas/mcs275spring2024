    "\n",
    "*Put the code you write for this problem in `hwk2prob2.py`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "A *word chain* is a list of words (which we'll represent as a list of Python strings) where the last letter of each word is the same as the first letter of the next word.  For example, this is a word chain:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\"optimistic\", \"crustaceans\", \"suspend\", \"disbelief\", \"furtively\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Of course any list with zero or one words would be considered a word chain, because there's nothing to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the following is **not** a word chain\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\"intense\", \"evaluation\", \"never\", \"reveals\", \"anything\", \"great\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "because the last letter of `reveals` differs from the first letter of the next word, `anything`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second list shown above does have some slices that are word chains, though.  For example, if the list `[\"intense\", ... , \"great\"]` shown above is called `L`, then the following are a few examples of slices of it that **are** word chains:\n",
    "```\n",
    "L[1:3] = [\"evaluation\", \"never\"]\n",
    "L[0:4] = [\"intense\", \"evaluation\", \"never\", \"reveals\"]\n",
    "L[4:5] = [\"anything\"]\n",
    "L[4:6] = [\"anything\", \"great\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "(This list is not exhaustive. There are other slices of `L` that form word chains.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following question:\n",
    "**Given a list of words, what is the longest word chain that it contains as a slice?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `longest_word_chain(L)` that takes a list `L` of words (strings) and returns a list of strings that is a slice of `L`, is a word chain, and which has the longest length among slices of `L` that are word chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible that there could be a \"tie\" for longest word chain in `L`.  In that case, the function can return any slice that's a word chain of maximal length."
