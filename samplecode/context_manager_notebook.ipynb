    "\n",
    "Reasons why you would use context managers:\n",
    "1. To make explicit what part of a program holds a resource\n",
    "1. To ensure cleanup happens even if an exception occurs during use of a resource\n",
    "1. As an alternative to object destructors that include stronger guarantees about when they will be called.\n",

    "Special methods this involves:\n",
    "* `__enter__`\n",
    "* `__exit__`\n",

    "\n",
    "A class whose objects can be used in `with`-blocks is called a **Context Manager**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a context manager, a class just needs two methods:\n",
    "* `__enter__(self):` - Should perform acquisition, called when entering `with` block\n",
    "* `__exit__(self,exc_type,exc,tb):` - Should perform cleanup, called when exiting `with` block whether normally or because of an exception.  The three argments after `self` will be `None` if the `with`-block ended normally, and otherwise will contain information about any exception that happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "A context manager will *usually* also have a constructor, since that will be called when the object is created (often on the same line as the start of the `with`-block).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a context manager that temporarily changes the current working directory.  Upon exit from the with-block, it will restore the previous current working directory."
