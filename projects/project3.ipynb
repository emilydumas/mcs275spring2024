    "## The idea: Different ways to store a sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will put the project in context and describe the general idea.  It doesn't contain any information that is strictly required to produce a correct solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List - contiguous, occasional resizing\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's `list` object lets you add and remove items at any time---though as we've discussed, inserting items near the beginning of the list can be slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "What actually happens behind the scenes is that when you create a new empty list, Python reserves an area of memory that can store a certain number of items.  As you add things to the list, they go into this reserved area of memory.  At some point the reserved area may become full.  If it does, the next time you add something to the list Python will reserve an entirely new, larger region of memory, copy everything in the list over to that larger area, add the new item in, and then release the smaller reserved memory area that is no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary tree - a new node with every insert\n",
    "\n",
    "While `list` is great for an ordered sequence of values accessed by index, you could also store that kind of data in a binary search tree.  You could make the indices the keys of the nodes, and have each node also contain a `value` attribute that contains the item at that position in the list.  This would have some nice features, such as allowing a list where some indices exist and others do not, and making insertion at any position possible without a lot of copying of other elements to later positions.  However, a new node would be created as part of each `insert` operation, which might be a slow operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid - a tree of fixed-size blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**The focus of this project** is making a class `BlockNode` that behaves a bit like `list` (storing an ordered sequence of values accessible by zero-based index, and supporting insertion of new items at any position) but which uses a hybrid of the two approaches discussed above.  It will start with a list of a fixed length (6 in this assignment, but it could be any chosen constant) and store values there until it is full.  Then it will make another `BlockNode` object, also having its own list of the chosen fixed length, to provide additional storage.  This continues with all the `BlockNode`s made so far being arranged in a binary tree that keeps track of the order in which their small lists need to be joined together to get the entire sequence that is being stored.  In theory, this should provide a list-like structure where `insert` at any position is pretty fast, but where the creation of new objects happens less frequently than in a binary search tree with only one item in each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation: Block-based storage is common\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another reason we might consider using a collection of lists of a fixed size to store a larger sequence: It could help make saving the sequence to disk or another storage medium more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, when a computer program writes data to a file, it ends up in a **persistent storage medium**---a device that can continue to store data even when the computer it is part of is powered off or restarted.  Depending on the situation, that storage medium might be inside the computer you're using (e.g. an internal hard disk or SSD, or built-in flash memory of a smartphone), might be a separated device attached to it (a USB drive, an SD card in a professional camera, etc.), or it might be located inside a server housed in a distant datacenter (storage \"in the cloud\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistent storage is different from *memory*, the temporary storage used for things like programs that are currently running and the variables and data structures those programs are using.  Memory is cleared every time a device restarts or powers off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistent storage devices typically don't work with individual bytes, characters, integers, or other units of data familiar from the work we've been doing in MCS 275.  For example, you can't directly ask a USB flash drive to read one byte or one integer from a certain location.  Instead, there's a fixed *block size* that the device works with, and every request to read or write something must involve a whole number of those blocks.  Most USB flash drives use a block size of 4096 bytes, while the built-in flash memory of many smartphones uses a block size of 2112 bytes.  Other block sizes are in use as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to make an implementation of a `list`-like ordered sequence that was optimized for frequently saving it to a persistent storage medium, then it would be a good idea to organize it so that the structure was divided into pieces that each fit inside one of the blocks that the storage device uses.  Further, you'd want to make it so that a small change to the sequence (like adding one item) changes only a few of the blocks, making it fast to save those changes to persistent storage.  The `BlockNode` object you'll create here illustrates some of the ideas you might use to solve that kind of problem."

    "**ðŸ›ˆ The autograder will test this module in detail ðŸ›ˆ**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file called `bstore.py`.  It should define a single class called `BlockNode` that represents a node in a binary tree that will be used to store a list of integers (the *data*) that can have any length, and which supports insertion and retrieval by zero-based index.\n",
    "\n",
    "When imported as a module, `bstore.py` must not do anything other than define a class.  (If you like you can put test code in it that runs when `bstore.py` is executed as a script.  Any such code will be ignored when grading.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the usual `left`, `right`, and `parent` attributes, each instance of the class has three other instance attributes:\n",
    "* `content`, a list of 6 integers (initially `[0,0,0,0,0,0]`), some of which may be part of the data, and some of which may be unused at present (whatever value is will not matter, and they may be filled in later when more data is added)\n",
    "* `size`, the number of elements from the beginning of the list `content` that contain actual data (initially 0)\n",
    "* `left_size`, which contains the sum of all `size` attributes of nodes in the left subtree of this one.  (The class must make sure this property is maintained whenever changes are made to the tree!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The `BlockNode` class is not allowed to have any other instance attributes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that `BlockNode` simulates a fixed-size storage block that has enough room for 8 integers (6 for content, 1 for size, 1 for left_size) and two references to other `BlockNode`s (1 for left, 1 for right).  If working with a storage system that only allowed blocks of that size, this would be one way to organize the storage of an arbitary-length list that allows efficient insertion of new elements at any position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagrams will be helpful in explaining the behavior `BlockNode` must provide.  Here's a picture of a `BlockNode`.  Instead of indicating the `size` explicitly, we highlight the first `size` entries in the list `content` to indicate they contain data as opposed to unused space.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram of single BlockNode](images/blocknode0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These `BlockNode` objects are not used individually but in a tree structure.  Each node stores a chunk (contiguous sublist) of the data in `content[:size]`, i.e. in the first `size` elements of its 6-integer storage area `content`.  The left subtree contains chunks that appear earlier than this one in the data, while the right subtree contains chunks that appear later in the data.  That means you can recover the data by doing an inorder traversal of the tree and joining up all the `content[:size]` lists in the order you encounter them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this tree stores the data `[2,7,5,2,0,2,4,85,73,67,3,15]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram of a tree of BlockNodes](images/blocknode1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And inorder traversal of the tree recovers that sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram of inorder traversal of a tree of BlockNodes](images/blocknode2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there are a lot of ways to represent a given set of data by a tree.  Here's another tree storing the same data, `[2,7,5,2,0,2,4,85,73,67,3,15]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram of a different tree of BlockNodes](images/blocknode3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you'll see in the method descriptions below, you'll need to find ways to insert or retrieve an integer at a given index using this structure.  Here's a demonstration of how it is designed to make that possible.  When you look at the tree above, we see that the integer 85 is stored in one of the slots of `content` in the root node.  But what index does this correspond to in the data?  It might seem like we need to examine all the nodes in the left subtree to determine this, since they all contain chunks of data that appear before the ones at the root node.  But remember each node (including this one, the root) contains a `left_size` attribute that tells us exactly how many data elements are in the left subtree.  Since that is 6 in this case, it means that the three integers stored at this node are indices 6, 7, and 8.  Thus the integer 85 is `content[1]` for the root node and corresponds to `data[7]` (if we imagine `data` as a hypothetical list soring the same sequence of integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, every item in the tree has both a **data index** (its position in the data stored in the tree) and a **content index** (its position in the `content` attribute of the node it lies in).  Neither type of index is stored directly; they are computed as needed by methods of `BlockNode` using the `left_size` attributes.  Here is a diagram showing both types of indices for each item in the tree above:\n",

The only allowable change to `content` is item assignment (e.g. `self.content[0] = 41` puts 41 at position 0).  If optional argument `initial_content` is not `None`, then it is expected to be a list of integers of length no more than 6.  After performing other initialization, the constructor will copy the integers from `initial_content` into the first `len(initial_content)` indices of the instance attribute `content`, and then set the `size` attribute accordingly.\n",

    "### About node insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "The method `insert` is the most complex one to write.  Let's discuss the idea a bit.  Suppose you have a `BlockNode` tree where the data item at index 15 is the integer 100, and the node `A` containing that integer full (meaning that node already contains 6 data items).  If `insert(15,999)` is called, then we can't simply put 999 into `A.content` attribute of that node because there would be no room for the displaced item 100 in that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we might be able to make room by bumping the the first or last item in `A.content` to another node.  However, we can't use just any node; it would need to be the node that comes immediately after or before `A` in the inorder traversal of the tree, so the order of the data is preserved.  Locating that node is somewhat complex---it may not be a child of `A` for example---and could easily run afoul of the rule that only `A`, its children, and its ancestors can be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, you should add a new empty node between `A` and one of its children in such a way that the new node is forced to come immediately after or immediately before `A` in the inorder traversal.  Then, you can push some of the content from `A` to this new node, so that both `A` and the new node have some free space, while preserving the order of the data.  (In fact, it's best to do this in a way that moves *half* of the data out of `A`, so we have two half-full nodes instead of one completely-full one.)"

    "Your project must follow the rules in the [MCS 275 coding standards](https://www.dumas.io/teaching/2024/spring/mcs275/nbview/policies/codestd.html) document.  In addition:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Only submit `bstore.py` and `bstoredemo.py`** - The autograder will supply everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No replacement of `content` attributes** - Once a `BlockNode` is created, the attribtue `content` should remain as the same 6-element list object forever.  The items in the list may change, but the attribute itself should never be assigned a different value.  That is:\n",
    "    - In a method of `BlockNode`, writing `self.content[k] = x` is OK\n",
    "    - In a method of `BlockNode`, writing `self.content = ...` is FORBIDDEN except when the attribute is first created in the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Make proper use of trees** - Your `BlockNode` class must have the ability to build trees where an arbitrary number of nodes have both left and right children.  Without this, you really have just a list of nodes, not a proper tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Make proper use of structured programming** - Have methods call one another when appropriate, rather than having lots of duplicated or near-duplicate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No use of `float` except to store elapsed time** - No values of type `float` can be created or used in `bstore.py`.  In `bstoredemo.py`, the only `float` values that are permitted are those used to compute elapsed time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Methods of `BlockNode` should never make a list of the entire data** - A silly way to do some of the things requested would be to convert the entire tree of nodes into a huge list of all the data, then do something with that list to complete the task.  This is analogous to converting a binary tree to a list instead of using a proper search algorithm---it is wasteful and unnecessary.  Always make proper use of the tree structure to do the things requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reasonable efficiency** - The autograder will allow up to 5 seconds for each test case in `bstore.py` to run, and will let `bstoredemo.py` run for up to 25 seconds.  If the time limit is reached without the test being completed, no points will be given.  **I strongly suggest you avoid worrying about the time it takes to do things UNLESS you have a working program that is failing tests solely because of taking too long.** Most likely this will never be an issue, and tests that fail because of a timeout will only occur if your code has a genuine bug that causes it to be stuck in an infinite loop or other process that will never finish."
