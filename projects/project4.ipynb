However, if your project uses any such packages that were not already required for MCS 275 course activities, you will need to tell me about it.  Do so either in the testing instructions in `README.md` or in the \"proper\" way by including a file `requirements.txt` in the main directory of your project that lists the required packages.  There is a tool `pipreqs` (installable with `python3 -m pip install pipreqs`) that can automatically examine your project and determine everything that needs to appear in `requirements.txt`.

    "**Example:** You can't get your login page to work.  You talk to your friend Greta who built something like this in IT 202 last semester.

First, this use of Stack Overflow and a brief description of what it was used for should appear in `README.md` under \"Sources and credits\".  Second, the section of the source code that is adapted from that source must be labeled with comments that provide a a precise citation, including a complete URL.

All you had to do was change the function name to match the one you used for the function elsewhere in your work.\n",

First, the fact that you consulted ChatGPT for help with a SQLite-related Python function (and anything other category of thing you used it for) should appear in `README.md` under \"Sources and credits\".

A session cookie (something you'll need to learn about) is set in the user's browser upon successful login so subsequent pages they visit know they are logged in.  Other parts of the app cannot be seen unless the user is logged in.\n",

But it's a solid project idea that fits naturally into the web app example we built in class.  It's also the kind of thing you'd want experience with if seeking a software development internship that might include web programming.\n",
    "    * **What I insist**: Do not store passwords in the database.  Doing so is never a good idea.  Instead, compute the bcrypt hash of the password and store that.  When you want to check a password, compute its bcrypt hash and see if it matches.  This process is described in detail [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-hash-passwords-in-python/).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Web app history and analytics.** Modify the web app from lecture to also maintain an append-only table that logs every action ever taken (every new task, every task state change, etc.).  Make a separate view in the application that displays some charts and graphs summarizing those data (e.g. bar chart of number of task actions by user, a line plot of overall tasks completed by week, ...).\n",
    "    * **What I worry about**: Returning an image generated in Python as a HTTP response is tricky.  You'd want to look into that ASAP and either get a working prototype or ask me for help.  Also, you'd need to specify a way I could test this and really see interesting output.  That probably means giving me a database that already contains a bunch of log data.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **JSON API.** We built a web app that works in the browser.  But what if you wanted to write a command line Python interface to the same Flask application?  In that case you'd want to have a way for programs to request application data (like a list of open work orders) in a structured format, and request application-related actions (like assigning yourself to a work order).  Add an API like this that would make it possible to do anything that's possible in the browser interface directly from a Python program that communicates with the web app over HTTP.\n",
    "    * **What I worry about**: Not much.  I think this is a good one, and for some reason people didn't choose it the last time I suggested it.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Meme maker.** A web form lets you choose a background image from a fixed collection (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Success_Kid) and enter text to draw onto the image as an amusing caption.  Upon submission of the form, Pillow (or another image manipulation library) is used to draw the requested text and provide the annotated image for the user to download.  In addition, the final captioned image then becomes an entry in a voting system, where users can give a meme a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.  Users who visit another page in the application can either browse and vote on newly created memes, or view a list of memes ranked according to score.\n",
    "    * **What I worry about**: It's a simple idea, so I'd have correspondingly high expectations for the level of polish and completeness. Also, you might need to return an image generated in Python as a HTTP response, which as noted above is tricky.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MCS 260 Fall 2020 Project 1 autograder.** A web app offers a form with a field for entering a username, and a large text entry box where the user is expected to paste a Python script that solves the simple coding exercise described [here](https://www.dumas.io/teaching/2020/fall/mcs260/project1/project1.pdf).  Upon submission, the application runs the script on the server with several inputs and checks the output against the expected results.  A report indicating the result for each test case (pass or fail) is shown to the user, and both the total score and individual test results are stored in a database.  A different page in the same application allows the instructor to view a table of scores for all users who have submitted programs.\n",
    "    * Running code submitted by a user on the web application server is very dangerous.  In a real application of this sort, you'd use some kind of \"sandbox\" to isolate the user code from the application server.  You don't need to handle any such isolation in this project, but you should know that it is important in real world applications.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **Flash cards web app.**  This web application is designed to help humans memorize key-value mappings (such as the definitions of a collection of terms, or the translations of a set of words from one language to another).  The core feature is a test: The \"front\" of a card (i.e. the key) is shown and the user is asked to enter the contents of the \"back\" of the card (i.e. remember the value).  Right and wrong answers are tracked.  There is a definite probability that any card will be shown, but cards that haven't been seen are much more likely to show up, as are cards that haven't been seen too recently which have a low success rate in recent trials.  A database stores all results with timestamps, so work can resume at any time from any device able to connect and render the HTML.  A separate page within the app can be used to add or remove individual cards, reset the statistics, or clear out all existing cards.\n",

    "1. **What are you working on?** A web application that provides a way to share a short description of what you're working on that others can view at any time.  To post, a user visits a certain URL and enters their username and a short description of what they're doing (e.g. \"Writing the Project 4 description for my class\") into a HTML form.  After submitting the form, the application will respond to requests at a certain URL involving the username (e.g. \"/status/ddumas\") and serve a page that displays that user's most recent submission in large text.  The page showing a user's current status also has a link to a page which gives the history of their past submissions, listed with their dates and times of posting.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event tracker.**  This application is for people who want to track how often (or for how long) they do something.  For example, it might be used to track exercise or sleep.  The main interface has a big button that a user can press to indicate either the start of an event (e.g. I'm about to start exercising) or the end of an event (e.g. I just finished exercising).  The  interface shows whether an event is currently underway, to make the current function of the button (start or stop) clear.  A database stores the event history.  Events that are started but not stopped after a certain amount of time are marked as \"incomplete\".  Using a separate configuration page, the user can indicate whether incomplete events are ignored, or if they are assigned a default duration (like 45 minutes), and how long the application waits before declaring an event incomplete.  A reporting page provides lots of information about the recent history, such as the longest event, shortest event, average event duration, average number of events per day, events per week, longest streak of days with at least one event, length of current streak, etc.\n",
    "    * **What I worry about**: Without the logic to handle incomplete events in a user-configurable way, this application idea would probably be too simple to make a suitable project.<br><br>\n",

    "1.  I think it would be really nice to make a web application that serves as a visualization of the Project 3 solution.

When you do so, the visualization updates accordingly. \n",
