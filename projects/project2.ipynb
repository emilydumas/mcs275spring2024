    "### Myth\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Greek mythology, the **labyrinth** was a vast and complex maze designed and constructed by the master inventor Daedalus on the island of Crete.  A half-human, half-bull creature called the Minotaur was then imprisoned within the labyrinth.  Some years later, Theseus (son of the king of Athens) sailed to Crete, navigated the labyrinth, and killed the Minotaur.  Theseus returned to Athens and was hailed as a hero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rethinking the story\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine an a different version of the story where the Minotaur is warned of an imminent attack by Theseus and plans an escape from the labyrinth.  We'll make this idea more precise and then give a programming project based on the scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suppose the labyrinth has unclimbable stone walls and a stone floor, but it is open to the sky above.  (It is often depicted this way in artwork based on the myth.) We suppose the layout is based on a rectangular grid, where some of the grid squares (or *cells*, as we'll call them) are entirely filled by stone walls.  Having spent many long years in a lair at the center of the labyrinth, the Minotaur does not know the full floor plan.  However, Daedalus left behind a few hundred drawings of potential designs, and it is nearly certain one of them shows the final design.  **A speedy escape requires preparing a computer program that can analyze all of the potential maps quickly.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The labyrinth is not just a maze, for in addition to its winding and branching passages, there are three types of obstacles:\n",
    "1. There are some deep **pits** lined with sharp spikes; falling into one of these means certain death.\n",
    "1. Some areas of the maze are blocked by massive **locked doors**.\n",
    "1. Some floor tiles are actually **spring-loaded traps** that hurl anyone who steps on them high into the air.  The subsequent fall is sure to be deadly, and anyway an object at such height can surely be seen by approaching Athenians. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, the Minotaur has ideas about how to overcome each type of obstacle:\n",
    "1. The Minotaur can choose to carry a long wooden plank, which can be used as a bridge over any pits.  However, the heavy plank will slow the escape and so it is important to know if it is truly necessary.\n",
    "1. The Minotaur has found and stockpiled some large brass keys that can unlock any of the doors.  However, each key becomes permanently stuck in the mechanism of whatever door it opens.  (The number of heavy keys to carry is thus an important question.)\n",
    "1. The Minotaur has a pair of hand-made wax wings (also designed by Daedalus and famously used by his son Icarus who flew too close to the sun).  The wings are too small to allow the large Minotaur to fly, but after stepping on a spring trap they allow the otherwise deadly fall to be turned into a survivable glide.  It will still tip off the Athenians, so this only helps if the Minotaur can glide directly to the exit and make a hasty departure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan to use wings to deal with spring traps is the trickiest and most dangerous part of the plan.  The Minotaur is not sure how far it will be possible to glide after hitting a spring trap, so plans will need to be made for various estimates of the flight range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Be the Minotaur\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you play the role of the Minotaur, writing a program to solve labyrinths littered with obstacles under various constraints (e.g. presence or absence of a plank, number of keys, limited glide distance)."

    "The method `L.save(fp)` writes a labyrinth object `L` to a file.  To read a labyrinth from a file and return the corresponding object, you need to call `Labyrinth.load(fp)` with `fp` a file open for reading.  Note you don't create a labyrinth instance directly in this case; you call `.load` using the **class name** `Labyrinth`.  It makes an instance and returns it.  Sample usage:"

    "* **Only submit `minotaur.py`** - The autograder will supply everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No changes to existing classes** - Obviously it would be a bad idea to change anything in the files provided in the sample pack, since the autograder will use fresh unmodified copies when testing your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No output** - The functions in `minotaur.py` must not print anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No modification of status dictionary** - After calling a function from `minotaur.py` that accepts a status dictionary, the values in that dictionary must not be changed.  Rather than making changes, create new dictionaries as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clean import** - Importing `minotaur.py` should not do anything other than defining functions.  It's fine to include test code, but put it inside a `if __name__==\"__main__\":` block so it only runs when the file is executed as a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Make proper use of structured programming** - Several of the functions in `minotaur.py` are most naturally written by calling other functions in the same file.  Make use of that technique when appropriate, rather than having lots of duplicated or near-duplicate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No use of `float` except for distance comparison** - The only time you can use float values is to compute and compare distances between points, i.e. to determine whether the `flight_distance` in a status dictionary is greater than the distance between the current cell and the goal.  Remember that `Vector2` has an `abs()` method so you can compute the distance from `p` to `q` with `abs(q-p)`!\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reasonable efficiency** - The autograder will allow up to 5 seconds for each test case to run, and will not give credit if a test runs longer than that.  These tests will use labyrinths sized so that a reference solution based on the techniques covered in lecture returns an answer in a small fraction of a second, so there is considerable leeway for a correct answer to have some level of inefficiency and still pass the tests.  However, functions that can in principle return the correct answer but only after doing a huge amount of unnecessary or inefficient work may lose credit due to these time-outs."
