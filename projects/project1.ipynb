    "### Shipping parts\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an employee of a manufacturing company that produces parts for wind turbines.  Once manufactured, the parts are packed into crates and shipped by truck to another company that assembles the turbines (using parts from several other manufacturers, too).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of parts (0, 1, and 2) your company makes, but they share a number of properties:\n",
    "* They are all approximately the same size, so one part of any type fits in (and fills) a standard shipping crate\n",
    "* It takes two hours to make a single part of any type,\n",
    "* Each part has a dedicated production line that manufactures that type of part 24 hours a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since three shipping crates fit in a truck, this makes coordination of shipping easy:  When a truck pulls up it waits for one crate to come off of each production line.  Then the truck drives away with one part of type 0, one of type 1, and one of type 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "This entire process has been automated using robotic loaders, and all the plant's equipment is controlled by software written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A complication appears\n",
    "\n",
    "When your company's contract to produce turbine parts is renewed, the scope of work expands.  Now they must:\n",
    "* Produce **five** types of parts (0,1,2,3,4) by adding two new production lines (for types 3,4)\n",
    "* Upgrade the existing production lines so the manufacturing time is less than two hours, though this means the exact time required to produce a part varies from line to line and over the course of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, all five parts are still of the same size, so you can still use the standard crates.\n",
    "\n",
    "These changes create problems in the plant's shipping depot.  Trucks will now arrive more frequently, but each truck still only holds three crates.  With five lines producing five types of parts at varying and unpredictable rates, some sort of plan is needed to decide which crates to load into a truck when it arrives.  Further complicating things is the fact that storage space at the plant is very limited; **the depot itself has no extra space**, and **each production line can only store a few of its finished parts before they run out of room** and need to shut the line down.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been assigned to solve this problem by updating the software controlling the robotic loaders.  The existing Python software uses sensors in the plant to check and report how many crates are waiting on each production line, and is able to instruct the robotic loaders to move the next crate from any line to a truck.  A class representing the idea of a truck-loading strategy has already been sketched out, so all you need to do is create subclasses that implement various strategies the plant will test."

    "### Summary of the factory software structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object and facility involved in the shipping operation (crates containing turbine parts, waiting areas at the end of the production lines, the strategy for deciding what to put on a truck, etc.) is represented by a Python class or object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finished parts that have been packed in crates are tracked by the manufacturing facility software, which creates an instance of class `Crate` (in `fixtures.py`) for each one.  While each `Crate` object contains a bunch of data about the contents, the details vary from production line to production line, so the shipping software won't actually look into the contents of any `Crate` object.  You'll treat each `Crate` object as a unit that gets moved around, not examined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each production line stores its finished crated parts in a *queue* (a line where newly made parts are added at one end and parts are taken out to be shipped from the other end).  The state of each such storage area is represented by an object of class `CrateQueue`  (in `fixtures.py`).  That class has methods and attributes you can use to examine how full the storage area is, to examine the next crate waiting to be taken out, and to order the loading robots to take the next crate out and put it on a truck.  Thus, **calling methods of class `CrateQueue` is the main job of the system that controls truck-packing.***\n",
    "\n",
    "As described earlier, each `CrateQueue` has limited size.  If it becomes full, the associated production line shuts down temporarily.  Naturally, this is something the company wants to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each truck can hold three crates, the intended contents of a truck can be represented by a list of `Crate` objects (of length at most 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each strategy for deciding how to load the trucks (a *routing strategy*) is implemented by  a subclass of `Router` (class in `routing.py`).  The constructor of this class expects five `CrateQueue` objects, corresponding to the five production lines.\n",
    "The `Router` class has a method called `prepare_load()` which will be called any time a truck arrives at the facility.  This method should examine the queues of the different production lines, remove up to three `Crate` objects from them, and return those objects in a list.  That list will then be used by the robotic loaders to pack the truck and to generate the shipping manifest and other documents that need to go with it.\n",

If I see that your program does not do what was requested in this document, but the error was not detected in the automated testing, a deduction may be given at this point.  The scores assigned by the autograder will not be changed during manual review unless I discover some kind of intentional wrongdoing (such as an attempt to circumvent or reverse-engineer the autograder's operation)."
