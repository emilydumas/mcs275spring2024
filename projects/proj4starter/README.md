## Description

[50-250 word description of the purpose and form of your project.
Assume I haven't seen your code, because I will read this long
before I open any .py files.]

## How to test

[How to use your program, including sample commands I should run in the
terminal, actions I should take once the program is running, URLs to
visit, etc..  Must make sense without having looked at your source code.
Be sure to explain any setup or initialization.  If I try the commands
you suggest and they don't work, that's a big problem!
BE CLEAR. BE SPECIFIC. ]

## Personal contribution

[What part of the work to create this project was your personal
contribution? Be detailed and specific.  If I can't understand exactly
what you did, as compared to what you adapted from other sources, then
you haven't written enough.]

project and how they contributed.  Any code that was used in your
project that was written by someone else---even if you modified
it---requires a detailed citation to be given in comments in the source
code IN ADDITION to being listed here as a source.]
