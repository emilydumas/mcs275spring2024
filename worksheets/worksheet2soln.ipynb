    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a list of integers.  Even if the list is not entirely in increasing order, there are sometimes *parts* of the list that are in increasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider `L = [1,21,4,17,38,39,35,22,0,6,2,5]`<sup>*</sup>. The list is not in increasing order, but the first two elements (i.e. `L[0:2]` or `[1,21]`) are in increasing order.  Also, if you take the slice `L[2:6]`, which is `[4,17,38,39]`, that is in increasing order.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Write a function `IRL(L)` that takes a list `L` and returns the length of the longest increasing run within `L`.  In order for that to make sense, you should assume the elements of `L` can be compared to one another using `>` and `<` and `==`, but it shouldn't matter exactly what their types are.  If it helps in thinking about the problem, you could imagine they are integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special cases (not necessarily requiring special handling, but explained here to clarify the extremes):\n",
    "* If `L` is empty, the function should return 0\n",
    "* If `L` is in decreasing order, the function should return 1 because a slice with one element can be considered to be in \"increasing order\", and that would be the longest increasing run.\n",
