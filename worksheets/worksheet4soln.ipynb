    "## 3. Lockfile context manager\n",
    "\n",
    "### The idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, a program will read or write a data file which might also be accessed by another program at the same time.  In such cases, it may be necessary for one program to have exclusive access to the file at certain times (e.g. to make changes without fear another program will read partially updated or corrupted data).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of mechanisms for handling this situation. One of the oldest approaches is to use a second file, a **lockfile**, that will be created when a program needs exclusive access to the data file and removed when the period of exclusive access ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this precise, imagine there might be a file called `keyring.dat` that is used by a password manager system.  It might be used by a Python program that lets you view or edit passwords stored there, and by a web application that integrates the password database with a browser.  Each of these programs may need exclusive access to `keyring.dat` at various times. A lockfile system for this purpose might look like this:\n",
    "* When any program wants exclusive access to `keyring.dat`, it checks to see whether a different file named `locked-keyring.dat` already exists\n",
    "    * If so, the program pauses for 0.1 seconds and tries again\n",
    "    * If not, the program creates an empty file named `locked-keyring.dat` and considers its exclusive access to `keyring.dat` to be obtained\n",
    "* When a program that is exclusively using `keyring.dat` is finished using it, it removes `locked-keyring.dat`, allowing other programs to claim exclusive use of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there can be problems with lock files in general, this structure is a good candidate for implementation using a context manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your task\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a context manager class `OpenWithLock` whose constructor accepts a filename `fn` (such as `keyring.dat`) and a `mode` (such as `\"w\"` or `\"r\"` or `\"a\"`, specifying the type of access to a file).  When entering an associated `with`-block, this context manager will\n",
    "* Wait 0.1 seconds repeatedly until there is no file named `\"locked-\"+fn` exists\n",
    "* Create (i.e. open and then close) an empty file called `\"locked-\"+fn`\n",
    "* Open the file named `fn` in mode `mode` and return the file object\n",
    "\n",
    "And when exiting the `with`-block, this context manager will\n",
    "* Close `fn`\n",
    "* Delete `\"locked-\"+fn`\n",
