    "Instead of using the `PrimRandomMaze` class to generate a maze, write your own subclass of `Maze` that creates a maze in which `start` and `goal` are set, the border is fully blocked, and so that it is possible to get from `start` to `goal`.  The constructor should create some obstacles between the start and goal, to make the maze more interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might make a class that simply places a large rectangle of blocked squares in the middle of the maze, so that a solution must either go along the top and right, or bottom and left.  Or you might make some walls coming out of the sides, so that a solution needs to turn back and forth several times.  Or you could make the start at the center, and surround it by walls that force any solution to take a spiral path out to a goal on the edge.\n",

    "* Ability to generate a maze of a given size (specified as arguments to the constructor)\n",
    "* Certainty that the maze always has a solution\n",
    "\n",
