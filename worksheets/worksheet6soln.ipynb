    "\n",
    "Recall that a *stack* is a data structure that mimics a physical stack of items, where the only available operations are to remove the top item (\"pop\") or add a new item to the top (\"push\").\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can simulate a stack using a list by limiting yourself to only calling the methods\n",

    "* `.append(x)` for the stack push operation\n",
    "In this way, the end of the list becomes the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mergesort, the main step was to create a function that can merge two sorted lists.  We made a version of this that uses indexing by integers.  However, the algorithm for merging two sorted lists only ever needs to look at the \"next\" item from each of the lists, meaning it can also be implemented using stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a function `merge_sorted_stacks(A,B,S)` that takes two stacks `A` and `B` whose elements are in sorted order, with the top of each stack being the smallest element, and an initially empty stack `S`.  The function should merge the two stacks into a single reverse-sorted stack `S`.  It can destroy `A` and `B` as it does so.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember, `A`, `B`, and `S` will actually be Python list objects.  The only thing that makes them stacks is that you won't use any methods or operations on them except `.pop()` and `.append(x)`.**\n",

That is, fraction `frac` of the positions are chosen randomly from a wider range, but the rest are linearly increasing.\n",

For example, if `n=10` and `k=2` you might get a return value like `[5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4]` because pieces `[0,1,2,3,4]` and `[5,6,7,8,9]` were reassembled in the opposite order.
