    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is not a perfect tool for making graphs of functions (because it doesn't know about continuity, domain, etc.; it just plots data point).  But it can be used for this.  To get started working on your own with matplotlib, make plots of the following functions according to the given specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "A single figure shows a range of 1 to 20 on the x axis and 0 to 600 on the y axis.  The graphs of four functions are shown:\n",
    "* $f(x) = 100 \\log(x)$ is shown in a thin, dotted black line\n",
    "* $f(x) = 15x$ is shown in dark blue\n",
    "* $f(x) = 10x \\log(x)$ is shown in orange\n",
    "* $f(x) = x^2$ is shown in red, with a thicker line\n",
    "\n",
    "(In these expressions, $\\log(x)$ means the natural logarithm, which is the usual mathematical convention and is consistent with the name in numpy.  The same function is sometimes called $\\ln(x)$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The x axis should be labeled \"x\", and the y axis should be labeled \"Instructions executed\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot should have a legend showing which function corresponds to each color and line style.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use 50 sample points when computing the arrays for these plots, and for the plot of $f(x) = 15x$, the individual data points should be marked with dots (in addition to the line running through them).\n",

    "Every atom has a nucleus that contains protons and neutrons.  The number of protons determines what chemical element the atom corresponds to, e.g. a hydrogen nucleus has one proton, a helium nucleus has two, and a carbon nucleus has 6.  My favorite element, tin, has nuclei with 50 protons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of neutrons can vary from one atom of an element to another.  Most carbon atoms have 6 neutrons, but some have 7 or 8.  These are called *isotopes* of carbon.  The 6- and 7-neutron carbon atoms are stable (they don't break apart on their own), while the 8-neutron ones are unstable: in time, such atoms undergo radioactive decay and turn into another element.\n",

    "Using data from the [International Atomic Energy Agency API](https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/api_v0_guide.html), I've constructed a CSV file containing data about 2935 nuclides.

    "* `instability` : A number between 0.0 and 1.0 which measures how unstable the nuclide is. (See [below](#Footnote:-What-instability-measurement-is) if you want a more detailed explanation.) A value of 0.0 means stable or very slow decay; 1.0 means fast decay.  (float)\n",

If you want, you can use that site as a reference for certain aspects of what your plot will look like.

You'll want something similar for this problem, so here is a polished version of that code you can use.  You just call `csv_columns(fn)` with `fn` replaced by a filename to get such a dictionary as the return value.\n",
