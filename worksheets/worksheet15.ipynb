    "# 2. Clone and modify the sample game\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we have a simple `pygame` game in the course sample code repo.  Depending on when your lab is held (Tuesday or Thursday), various additional features may have been added to the game.  For this activity, your goals are:\n",
    "* make a local clone of the git repository\n",
    "* add at least one feature to the game (testing it, of course)\n",
    "* commit your changes\n",
    "* view the log of commits\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, open a terminal and `cd` to a directory (folder) where you want to work.  The repository will end up in a new subfolder.  Now run one of these commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Students in 12pm lecture\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/daviddumas/pygame-example-mcs275-spring2024-12pm.git\n",

    "git clone https://github.com/daviddumas/pygame-example-mcs275-spring2024-1pm.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should have a subfolder with a rather long name, and it should contain everything from the pygame example (images, code, etc.).  Change directory into that one and run `git log` to see the log of commits.  It should show a bunch of commits and their descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, add something fun and new, then commit your work with `git add FILE1 FILE2 FILE3 etc` followed by `git commit`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Feature ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to add a new feature.  You can check the [PyGame home page](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) for some ideas.  I am leaving this open-ended so you can explore whatever interests you for the time you are given in lab.  Looking at what the [pygame examples](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/examples.html) do and thinking about how features seen there could be adapted to our game is one way to approach this.  Here are some other ideas to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* New keyboard controls: Perhaps `w` should warp the player to a random location.  Or maybe there should be several player avatars/skins (different PNG images) and pressing `/` cycles between them.\n",
    "* Walls: Make a black and white PNG image of the same size as the game window.  Arrange it so the image is loaded at the start and drawn on the display surface during each game loop.  Make it so that the player can only move to a location if the background is white at that position.  Thus, black areas effectively become walls.\n",
    "* Buddy drone: Make a small flying robot that orbits the player slowly.  That means the flying robot is represented by a small sprite and it moves in a circular pattern centered at the player's position (which, you must remember, changes!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most tasks will involve creating some new image assets.  I suggest making them with a pixel art editor.  Here's a free online one I recommend:\n",
    "* [PIXILART](https://www.pixilart.com/draw)\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, open the script in VS Code and add a conditional that detects when the integer 498 is about to be added and prints a message like\n",

As you do so, construct a picture of the path it takes through the tree (either on a piece of paper or by taking notes in a text file).  Determine the answers to these questions:\n",

    "* Describe the path from the root to the node containing `498` when the `insert` function is done (e.g. \"left, right, right, left, now it's in `.content[2]`\")"
