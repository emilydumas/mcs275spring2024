    "c1 in s2\n",
    "```\n",

    "        if c1==c2:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "    return False\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the worst case, this function performs `len(s2)` checks, and it runs for each character of `s1`.  If `s1` and `s2` are each of length 50,000, then this becomes 2,500,000,000 equality checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, most strings don't have that many distinct characters, so it would be faster to:\n",
    "* Find all of the distinct characters in `s1` (and make a set out of them)\n",
    "* Find all of the distinct characters in `s2` (and make a set out of them)\n",
    "* Check which characters lie in both of these sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The time it takes to do this would be roughly proportional to `len(s1) + len(s2) + n1*n2` where `n1` is the number of distinct characters in `s1` and `n2` is the number of distinct characters in `s2`.  In most cases `n1` and `n2` will be bounded by a fixed constant (like `26`, if the strings only contain lower case letters of the alphabet), so the main contribution to the running time is proportional to the lengths of `s1` and `s2` individually, rather than their product.\n",
