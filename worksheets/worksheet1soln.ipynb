    "One of the nice things about Python is that strings can contain any Unicode character (as opposed to strings in some other programming languages where the set of available characters is much more limited).\n",

    "```\n",

    "║  a box!  ║\n",
    "╚══════════╝ \n",
    "```\n",
    "The box drawing characters used above are:\n",
    "* `\\u2550`  or `═`\n",
    "* `\\u2551`  or `║`\n",
    "* `\\u2554` or `╔`\n",
    "* `\\u2557` or `╗`\n",
    "* `\\u255a`  or `╚`\n",
    "* `\\u255d`  or `╝`\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program `box.py` that prints a unicode text box of specified width and height.  It should expect at least two command line arguments, giving the width and height of the box.  If only those are given, the box should be printed to the screen.  If a third argument is given, it should be a filename and the box should be written to that text file instead of being printed to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, the command\n",
    "```\n",
    "python box.py 3 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "should result the following text being printed, exactly:\n",
    "```\n",
    "╔═╗\n",
    "║ ║\n",
    "║ ║\n",
    "╚═╝\n",

    "Similarly, the command\n",
    "```\n",
    "python box.py 12 2 box.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "should not print anything to the screen, but should result in a file `box.txt` being created that contains the following text, exactly:\n",
    "```\n",
    "╔══════════╗\n",
    "╚══════════╝\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended structure of your program:\n",

    "There are at most three different lines of text that appear in a box: The top of the box, the line that repeats some number of times to make the vertical sides of the box, and the bottom of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest you generate these three lines and store them in strings, and then assemble them into one bigger string that has all the lines and line breaks (`\\n` characters) that you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the strings, you can use the fact that multiplication of a string by an integer will repeat the string a certain number of times.  For example, `\"foo\"*3` evaluates to `\"foofoofoo\"`. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would be a good idea to put the part of the program that writes the box to a file into a function and have the rest of the program create a string that contains the box.  Then you can decide whether to print the string or call the function to write it to a file based on whether there is a third command line argument."
